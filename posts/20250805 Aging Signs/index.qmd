Few signs that you are aging or aged.

Tears come freely without warning.

Often in private but more and more in public settings.

In times of gladness but more often due to frailties of life.

A recognition that you have more in common with people.

Both familiar and less familiar.

Listen to opinions of others but seldom swayed.

The models that served you well are hard to part with.

A discussion leader said,

> Not a testimony of the model, rather the reality behind it.

Less effort to cling to the familiar.

Almost anything can be construed to be nostalgia.

Any number of triggers can remind of a time, place or a person.

Especially times and places that remind us that this life is temporary.

Wishing for persons to be unchanging and eternal, free from constraints of this life.

Unlikely.

Past is comfortable, unchanging, controllable

Future isn't

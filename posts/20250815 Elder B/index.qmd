Work for a small company in a small town, around 300 and 100,000 persons respectively.

Surprised to hear from 3 colleagues that their daughters and a nephew were called to labor in Korea, all entering the MTC on the same day.

The probability of this occurrence would be close to winning a lottery.

Like sending the space force cadets on a long-term mission, from a single neighborhood.

Often, I would check with their fathers and uncle to learn about their experiences and where they were serving.

성남, 서산, 강남, 군산, 청주, 천안.

Sisters got to serve in the Wards where we had relatives.

And when Sister K visited that relative, she was able to deliver a package from home.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

18 months and 24 months away from the comforts of a home is a sacrifice.

In some sense, this is an adventure, a spiritual one.

Many are visiting and sampling countries and cultures around the globe.

> How much time is necessary time to be immersed in a culture and understand its influence on people?

It is not days or weeks but months or years, based on my experience.

A consistent exposure to culture and an increased understanding of the language helps.

Always taken back by the language comprehension and command of nuance and subtlety of 사투리 (dialect) by those returning from the Korean Language Missions.

Even more amazing is when they express that it was the best times of their lives.

Sisters had returned home earlier this year.

Checked back with the colleague,

> When is your nephew coming home? 
> He just came home last Thursday.

Let's have a lunch together.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

His brother and a cousin joined as well.\
And the father of one of the sisters came as well.

When I saw him, I was surprised how young he looked. 
Like a high school student. 

In fact, I thought his brother was the returned missionary. 
(His brother is 22, he served in Mexico City area)

I drove with him to test his language skills. 
No hesitations, he answered all my prompts and asked appropriate questions, all with a zeal of a young man.

Refreshing to be around young people. 
For that hour, I forgot where I was, what I was eating and what my concerns were. 
I was taken back to my home, among the people Elder B served.

He mentioned the need for older missionaries. 
And how wonderful they are. 

Made me reflect on Psalm 8:2

> Through the praise of children and infants you have established a stronghold against your enemies, to silence the foe and the avenger

-   New International Version

He described his return flight home. There were 40 other missionaries going home.

Instead of flying them separately, the church decided to use the direct flight, ICN to SLC.

Then those missionaries would fly to their eventual destinations.

I imagined them spontaneously breaking into a half dozen song medley in the plane.

-   Come, Thou Fount of Every Blessing
-   Be Still, My Soul
-   Come, Follow Me
-   A Child’s Prayer
-   Called to Serve
-   Savior, Redeemer of My Soul

And the rest of the passengers joining in and singing the 3rd verse.

> O’errule mine acts to serve thine ends. Change frowning foes to smiling friends. Chasten my soul till I shall be In perfect harmony with thee.

O gracious God of Israel

Thank you for the lives of these young people and safely bringing them home.

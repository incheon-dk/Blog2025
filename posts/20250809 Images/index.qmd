Used to be phone-based cameras tried to catch up to DSLR (Digital Single Lens Reflex) cameras.

### **Apple – iPhone "Shot on iPhone" Campaign (2015–present)**

Apple heavily pushed the idea that iPhone photos could rival professional cameras.

Billboards, commercials, and online ads showcased real photos taken by iPhone users, sometimes directly compared to DSLR-like quality.

With the iPhone 7 Plus (2016) and its **Portrait Mode**, Apple began directly suggesting it could replace DSLR portrait photography.

If the metrics are the number of flawless images taken and shared.

Then we have a clear winner – cellphone cameras have won.

However, if one measures the progress towards understanding, pursuing and capturing, drawing with light.

Then the game isn't over.

The word **photography** comes from Greek roots:

**“phōs / phōtós” (φῶς / φωτός)** → *light*

**“graphé / graphein” (γραφή / γράφειν)** → *drawing, writing*

-   So literally, **photography means “drawing with light.”**

Is it possible to make progress without making mistakes?

Recently erased 110 GBytes of images on the phone.

Taken over 14 months, there were over 20000 images

Roughly averaged 50 images per day.

I could save just the "highlights"

Take the picture you want to draw, rather than hand the control over to camera brain.

So now the goal is to match Cellphone based camera image.

"My (DSLR/Mirrorless) camera images are just as good.

### **Samsung – Galaxy S & Note Series Ads**

-   

-   Samsung often ran ads with taglines like **“Do What You Can’t”** and directly compared Galaxy phone images to DSLR photos.

-   

-   For example, the **Galaxy S9 and Note 9 campaigns (2018)** pushed low-light performance with the slogan *“The Camera. Reimagined.”*

-   

-   Samsung positioned its variable aperture system (f/1.5–f/2.4) as DSLR technology in your pocket.

Ordering food through installed kiosks at each table.\nIn time, I would become more proficient and could mimic being a local person.\nHowever, there was one trend that proved to be difficult to overlook.\nTasks in big city were mostly transactional.\nNo room, or more accurately no time for getting personal or have a human interaction.\nIn an area, covered with as if 人山人海, I felt alone. Tides of people in the morning and even more people in the evening hours.\nI would not know how to adjust to this setting where people appear to congregate and get things done, then retire to their areas of refuge, into their cubicles in the sky.\nI could adjust, but given a choice, I will take a small town with its inconveniences over a big town living.\n談的談 說的說\n小城故事真不錯\n請你的朋友一起來\n小城來做客\nTalking here, and chatting there,\nSmall town stories are so fine.\nBring your friends along with you,\nCome and spend some time."

    "text": "손자(孫子):\nHi Grandpa, came across some digital photos from the year of the Snake (乙巳)1.\nWasn’t this the period when you were slowing down and transitioning from company funded trips?\nThe photos told a different story.\nOlder Me:\nThat was the year the oldest of your maternal uncles got married, Uncle JH.\nYes, that was post company sponsored travel days. And I thought of taking things slower but your grandma had other ideas.\nShe was invited to the wedding in Korea and scheduled to travel there.\nBut I wasn’t – initially.\nLike many things in life, women’s willpower changes the outcome.\nSoon, I was making travel plans and thinking of people and places to meet and visit.\n손자(孫子):\nSo how did you go about detailed planning? Without specifics of business trips.\nOlder Me:\nWe have visited Korea a number of times, but this was the first time only 2 of us traveled.\nAt that time we had sold the business that required the attention of grandma. Because I was working at the time, chose a 10-day visit duration. Planned around the wedding.\nThat opened up many options and possibilities.\nIn addition, a direct flight to Incheon, Korea, had begun just few weeks prior to the visit.2\nI had a number of aunts and uncle that were in their 80s and 90s.\nMy mother’s younger siblings in Korea were, 90 and 87.\nMy father’s youngest brother was 82.\nMy mother’s church friend was 90.\nVisiting them was my priority.\nPlus I wanted to visit my hometown 인천(仁川).\nThe remaining time would be spent either shopping or visiting sites around the country.\nI didn’t know how we could do all of this in 10 days.\nWe decided to visit 서울성전 at the beginning and at the end of our visit.\nAnd met with the uncle and aunts, the first 4 days we were in Korea.\n손자(孫子):\nI do remember stories about your aunts and uncles.\nI am glad you kept in touch with them over the years.\nHow did you get in touch with Grandma’s friends, after she had passed away?\nOlder Me:\nWe formed a group, LLJK, (이이정강).\nWe first met in 인천, during the early days of the Church in the area.\nWe had maintained our friendship with the help of the group chat.\nAll but L1 had moved to the States, when I told L2 and J that I would be traveling to Korea, they suggested I get in touch with L1, who lived in 마포 area of 서울\nL2 warned me that there aren’t many people that would remember me and advised me to visit and enjoy the local food.\nL1 met me on a day that was 90+ degrees Farenheit and same amount of humidity.\nI wanted to meet my aunt first and then tour the town.\nI wondered why he kept avoiding a lunchtime rendenvous\nAs a compromise, we met at 9AM at 동인천역(東仁川駅)\nBy 10AM the weather was brutal, I was struggling with the heat and the hilly streets\nAs we walked, L1 rehearsed the history and people associated with the church in Incheon (인천)\nStarted in 중앙동, in a rented, converted 2-story building. Recall, one of the floor had a tatami (畳) floor.\nThen a government property3 in 답동 was purchased and the existing building was renovated for church use.\nSubsequently a new building was built on site. Eventually, all of the 인천 area wards were combined into a single meeting house in 주안.\n손자(孫子):\nQuite a day. You were lucky that L2 was available and willing to take you to places. How did it feel to walk around the places of birth and growth?\nOlder Me:\nThings had changed dramatically in last 50 years. Except for few places that hadn’t changed, it was like many other places in modern Korea. Vertical growth and no green areas. Almost a feeling of visiting a foreign country.\nExcept, the memories of people and experiences. Meetings and activities in the old chapel.\nFriends that still remember who I was and accept me as who I have become.\n손자(孫子):\nSo did you visit your old church on Sunday?\nOlder Me:\nYes, I visited 인천1와드. That Ward was composed of the former, 답동, 송도, 주안 Wards\nAs we were driving towards the new building, I related the conversion story of my mother.\nShe had studied with the missionaries for nearly 2 years. But she still had some questions. She wrote them down.\nWhen Harold B. Lee visited Korea and my mother attended the fireside All of mother’s questions were answered by the visiting general authority. Mom’s mind was set to join the church - intellectually\nThen one afternoon, she dreamed a dream.\nIn the dream, there were 2 books. She could tell they were the Bible and the Book of Mormon. And a hand appeared and pointing to 2 books and touching them one by one said\nShe was ready to be baptized.\n손자(孫子):\nThanks for sharing that. So did anyone recognize you?\nOlder Me:\nL2 was correct, in a congregation of nearly 150 people only 3 people knew me. L2’s mother. L1’s sister and her husband.\nI wondered if this will be similar to how we will be welcomed into the next life. There will be we may know and recognize but only a few would personally escort us through.\nThat person this time was L2’s mom.\nShe recounted how she and my mother served in the Stake Primary Presidency, without really understandint the calling.\nThen she recounted my mother’s dream about the hand and 2 books. Almost word for word.\nMy testimony was strengthened. I had come home to my and my family’s Bountiful.\nThank you members of the 인천 area. In particular, thank you Sister 임윤님, Brother 유관종, Sister 이강주. For remembering me, welcoming me, and confirming the faith of my parents."

He had 3 younger brothers and a sister\nMy mother was the oldest, she had a sister that remained in North, due to bombings she was not able to join the family. There were daughter and son that perished. So mother and the 5th child is significant.

    "text": "IRVINE, Reed (John) 1922-2004\nOBITUARY NOTICE— See index for CA sketch: Born September 29, 1922, in Salt Lake City, UT; died of complications following a stroke November 16, 2004, in Rockville, MD. Consumer advocate, economist, and author. Irvine was the founder of the watchdog group Accuracy in Media (AIM). A graduate of the University of Utah, where he earned a B.A. in 1942, Irvine acted as an intelligence officer in the Pacific theater during World War II. After the war, he returned to school, first at the University of Washington and then attending Oxford University on a Fulbright scholarship. He graduated from Oxford in 1951 and was hired as an economist at the Federal Reserve System board of governors. From 1963 until 1977 he was international finance adviser for the Far East section. It was while working for the Federal Reserve that he got his idea to form AIM out of frustration with what he considered to be the slanted liberal perspective of the media. Founded in 1969, AIM often worked to get equal air time on television and space in newspapers for its more conservative views, and Irvine also wrote a syndicated column that was printed in about one hundred newspapers. The organization saw its most influential period during the years Ronald Reagan was president, declining somewhat in the 1990s as Irvine became increasingly preoccupied with investigating conspiracy theories, such as his belief that the crash of TWA Flight 800 was caused by a missile and that White House deputy counsel Vincent W. Foster Jr. might have actually been murdered, not a victim of suicide, in 1993. In 1985, Irvine started a venture similar to AIM, known as Accuracy in Academia, but its conservative agenda and desire to wield influence over academic freedoms found fewer sympathizers. Irvine remained chair of AIM until 2003, when he retired as chairman emeritus. He was the author of Media Mischief and Misdeeds (1984).\n\nfrom Encyclopedia.com, https://www.encyclopedia.com/arts/educational-magazines/irvine-reed-john-1922-2004\n\n\nAccuracy in Academia (AIA)’s founder, Reed Irvine, died November 16, 2004 at the age of 82. Born in 1922, he served his country in World War II as a marine. He really never stopped serving his country.\nHe started Accuracy in Media (AIM), AIA’s parent organization, in 1969, to scrutinize the then-dominant old media at a time when few questioned its reporting. From the time he retired as a Federal Reserve Board economist in the 1970s until late last year, when he suffered a serious heart attack, he worked for AIM full-time.\nIt is fair to say that the so-called new media—Fox News, talk radio and even internet blogs—that prove the reporting of the venerable CBS News and company to be inaccurate are rushing through a door that Reed Irvine opened when he started going head-to-head with media heavyweights such as then-Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee.\nReed Irvine started AIA in 1985 because he saw that too many professors were using classrooms the way that too many reporters used newsrooms—to influence events rather than provide actual accounts of the past and present. He served as chairman of AIA until his death.\nSince the 1980s, his standards have guided AIA. In his late seventies, he went toe to toe with demonstrators who attempted to disrupt an AIA conference at Columbia University in New York City.\nWhen I first came to AIA last year, I read an e-mail that Reed forwarded around the office. He answered one of AIM’s critics by writing, “Show me one thing that we have written that is inaccurate.” No one could.\nOn October 22, 1985, Izvestiya, the state-run newspaper in the then-still existent Soviet Union, ran an article on the founding of Accuracy in Academia (AIA). Of all of the press coverage that AIA has received in its history, the Izvestiya write-up is arguably the most historically significant. Entitled ‘The Hunt For Freethinkers,’ the piece took aim at the then-infant group’s purpose.\n“By the look of things, henceforth students, with the start of their activities, will take out fountain pens and tape recorders,” Izvestiya predicted. “Teachers at universities are quivering with fear,” the Soviet press organ reported. “They tremble at the utterance of each word.”\n“For who knows?,” Izvestiya asked rhetorically. “Are the students taking notes on their lectures for their own purposes, or are they listening for the purpose of reporting what the teacher says to the ultra-right organization, Accuracy in Academia?”\nIzvestiya normally confined itself to attacking U. S. government policies and American society in general. Leveling a front-page broadside at a small non-profit group represented somewhat of an editorial departure for the journal. The attention Izvestiya devoted to AIA, then, gave the watchdog group quite a distinction.\n“The reactionary newspaper, The Washington Times, crows over the report that Accuracy in Academia, which has only existed for a few days, already has gathered voluntary informants on 110 university campuses throughout the United States,” Izvestiya noted.\n“At the call of their spiritual mentor, worshippers and apprentices of McCarthy hunt for teachers who have the courage to adhere to liberal convictions,” according to Izvestiya. The McCarthy that Izvestiya refers to is the late Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy, R-WI, famous for his investigations of communists in U. S. government jobs.\n“By such measures, these teachers are labeled ‘Marxists,’ which in contemporary America is pregnant with the most serious consequences,” Izvestiya asserted. “For example, political science professor Bertell Ollman knows this from personal experience for he dared admit that he was actually on the side of Marxism. Solely because of that he was not allowed to compete to fill a position at the University of Maryland.”\nSix years after the Izvestiya article appeared, the Soviet Union itself imploded and the Cold War ended. This year, AIA celebrates 19 years of life and is still in business. Izvestiya is still in business too, although under new management. And by the way, so is Bertell Ollman. A professor of politics at New York University, he teaches ‘Socialist Theory’ for undergraduates and ‘Communism’ and ‘Methods of Political and Social Analysis’ at the graduate level.\nBecause professors such as Ollman, and their understudies, are still in business, teaching the history of the Cold War from the Evil Empire’s perspective, AIA continues its work, as our founder would have wanted us to.\nAccuracy in Academia founder, Reed Irvine,\ndied November 16, 2004 at the age of 82.\nHis legacy as a true advocate of democracy lives on.\nReed Irvine, R. I. P.\nby: Malcolm A. Kline, November 17, 2004"
